* Persistence frameworks

** Hibernate

Big, clunky. 

** OJB


** SavePoint

First release in June 2007. Very simple, attractive. Only offers
Java-JDBC bridge - no object lifecycle management at all. No
object-relational mapping - SQL is all handwritten.

Not free but licence costs have not been revealed yet. Zero-cost for
use against "free" databases (mysql, hsqldb).

** iBATIS

Similar in concept to SavePoint. Less elegant. Still fairly small. No
external dependencies.

** Torque

Generates persistent classes statically instead of using
reflection/dynamic techniques. This is enough to rule it out of
contention. 

** Castor

A framework for both Java - XML and Java - relational mapping. 
Looks like Java-relational mapping is not its strong point. 


** Java UltraLite Persistence

Very small. Looks cheesy. Forces classes to extend his abstract
persistence object. No good.

** Prevayler

Not a relational database persistence layer, but an alternative
architecture based on in-heap (persistent) objects.

** Velosurf

Not really a Java persistence layer - more of an alternative syntax
for simple database queries.

** Java persistence API
